SPiD SDK for Android [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/schibsted/sdk-android.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/schibsted/sdk-android)
================

Supported Android version is 2.3 (API level 9) or greater. The SDK is currently using buildtools version 23.0.0.

The SDK can be built using the gradle wrapper included by running the following command(assuming that the android-sdk is installed):
```
./gradlew -p SPiDSDK build
```

The compiled library will be located in SPiDSDK/build/libs/

The SDK can also be installed to your local maven repository with the following command:
```
./gradlew -p SPiDSDK uploadArchives
```

For information and the development guides see our [Documentation](http://schibsted.github.com/sdk-android "Documentation").



Why fork ?

Since guys from SPID have have a big problem to provide this SDK through [repository](https://github.com/schibsted/sdk-android/issues/7) I decided to fork SPID repository and do this for them.


How can I use it ?
