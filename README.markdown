The SDK can be build using the gradle wrapper included by running the following command(assuming that the android-sdk is installed):
```

```

The compiled library will be located in SPiDSDK/build/libs/

The SDK can also be installed to your local maven repository with the following command:
```
./gradlew -p SPiDSDK install
```
