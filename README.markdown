SPiD SDK for Android
================

Supported Android version is 2.2 (API level 8) or greater.

Note that this uses the Maven Android SDK Deployer (https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer) for including the android sdk into maven. This fixes the issue of missing JSON libraries which is in the artifact deployed to Maven central.

For information and the development guides see our [Documentation](http://schibsted.github.com/sdk-android "Documentation").
